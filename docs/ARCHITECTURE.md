# Architecture Notes

## Map Component Animations
- **CSS Staggering**: Texas map SVG elements animate their regions (.texas-region) sequentially. The CSS resides globally in `src/styles/mobile.scss` to allow map blocks to trigger correctly regardless of whether they are rendered dynamically by WordPress or statically in Astro.
- **Scroll Reveal**: Instead of executing unconditionally on DOM load, a global `IntersectionObserver` within `src/layouts/Layout.astro` triggers animations (`.is-visible`) when the SVG map enters the viewport. This is more resilient for maps placed lower down on the page (like K-12).

## Design-Build Column Constraints
- **1200px Grid Bounds**: Consistent with user layout restraints, standard Design-Build columns layout constraints are set to a max-width of `1200px` and centered on the page.
- **Editor Synchronization**: SCSS files (`src/styles/mobile.scss` and `src/styles/desktop.scss`) configure these limits for both the frontend rendering and Gutenberg editor styling overrides. This prevents layout differences between the block editor view and the frontend.
